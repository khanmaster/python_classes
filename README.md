# This lesson covers python classes
## OOP Object Oriented programing 
### There are four pillars

- Inheritance 
**Eliminates redundant code**
- We can use all functions and variable from parent class

- Encapsulation
**Reduce complexity and increase reusability**
 
- Abstraction
**Reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes**

- Polymorphism - ploy (many) morphism (form) 
**Refactor code or case statements**
- It allows us to change behaviours or attributes/variable
```
 In object-oriented programming,
 polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.
 More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.


```

- What are classes and why
- class is the main factor that is used to implement any of these pillars
